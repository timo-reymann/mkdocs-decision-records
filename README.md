</p>



## Features

- Customizable status colors and lifecycle
- Enforces information to be present for ADRs
- Allows description being kept as markdown

## Installation

1. Install `mkdocs-decision-records` from the PyPi registry using your favorite package manager
2. Configure your `mkdocs.yml`
   ```yaml
   plugins:
   - decision-records:
       # Folder where your decision records are located, defaults to adr
       decisions_folder: adr
       # Optional prefix to prepend to ticket numbers
       ticket_url_prefix: https://ticket.example.com/
       # Configure amount of required deciders
       required_deciders_count: 1
       # Configure available stages and the badge colors
       lifecycle_stages:
         {status}: {color}
   ```
3. Create your ADRs ensuring to add the frontmatter meta data:
   ```markdown
   ---
   id: 000
   status: proposed | rejected | accepted | deprecated | â€¦ | superseded by
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   deciders:
      - decider 1
      - decider 2
   # Optional ticket
   ticket: FOO-1
   ---
   ```

## Motivation

I love ADRs and documenting decisions in general. This plugin makes it a bit easier, enforcing basic meta information
while keeping the format open enough so you can do your thing.
